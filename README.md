# School Management System (SMS)

**Building a traditional school management system with a solid foundation to leverage future Agentic AI features.**

The goal is to create proper user flows, structured data, and comprehensive payloads that AI agents can effectively utilize. First, the foundation must be rock-solid.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose

### One Command Setup
```bash
# Windows
start-dev.bat

# Linux/macOS  
./start-dev.sh
```

**That's it!** The script will:
- ‚úÖ Start PostgreSQL database
- ‚úÖ Start FastAPI backend with auto-reload
- ‚úÖ Start React frontend with hot-reload
- ‚úÖ Load comprehensive test data
- ‚úÖ Set up development environment

### Access Points
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Database Admin**: http://localhost:8080

## üèóÔ∏è Strategic Architecture

### Why Traditional First, AI Second?

**1. Rich Data Foundation**
- Comprehensive user interactions generate structured payloads
- Every quiz attempt, grade, and progress metric creates AI-ready data
- User behavior patterns establish training datasets

**2. Solid User Flows**
- Authentication, role-based access, and permission systems
- Complete CRUD operations for users, classes, quizzes
- Real-world workflows that AI agents can enhance, not replace

**3. Structured Data for AI Consumption**
- JWT tokens with role/permission metadata
- Detailed quiz responses and analytics
- Student progress tracking with granular metrics
- Teacher-student interaction logs


**4. Future AI Enhancement Ready (Now Multi-Tenant SaaS)**
- **Multi-Tenant Foundation**: All features and data are now tenant-aware, supporting multiple schools or organizations with strict data isolation and role-based access.
- **Automated Grading**: Rich quiz response data for ML models, scoped per tenant for privacy and customization.
- **Personalized Learning**: Student progress patterns and analytics are now tenant-specific, enabling adaptive AI for each organization.
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: User behavior and analytics are segmented by tenant, allowing for organization-aware suggestion engines.
- **Smart Scheduling**: Class/resource optimization algorithms can operate within each tenant, supporting unique schedules and constraints.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Early intervention and insights are tailored per tenant, supporting school- or organization-specific needs.
